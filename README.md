# Eventile - CS 2212 Team 18

We are currently developing an **event finder web application** that allows users to specify their interests and present nearby upcoming/on-going events that matches their interests.

## Software

We will be using Grails for our web application framework. Our back-end database will be using MySQL, and our front-end will use the Bootstrap framework, and possibly React.

# Eventile - CS 2212 Team 18

We are currently developing an **event finder web application** that allows users to specify their interests and present nearby upcoming/on-going events that matches their interests.

## Software

We will be using Grails for our web application framework. Our back-end database will be using MySQL, and our front-end will use the Bootstrap framework, and possibly React. 

## Additional Information

Each team member has their own branch, where we each implemented our own assigned features. The implemented features are then merged into the dev branch. After unanimous approval, the features are merged into the master branch.

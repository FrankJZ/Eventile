# Eventile - CS 2212 Team 18

We are currently developing an **event finder web application** that allows users to specify their interests and present nearby upcoming/on-going events that matches their interests.

## Software

We will be using Grails for our web application framework. Our back-end database will be using SQLite3 (built-in with Grails), and our front-end uses React.

Our software stack includes the following:

* Grails 3
* Spring Security Rest plugin
* Webpack
* React
* React Router
* Bootstrap

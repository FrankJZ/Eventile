# Eventile - CS 2212 Team 18

We are currently developing an **event finder web application** that allows users to specify their interests and present nearby upcoming/on-going events that matches their interests.

## Software

We will be using Grails for our web application framework. Our back-end database will be using SQLite3 (built-in with Grails), and our front-end uses React.

Our software stack includes the following:

* Grails 3
* Spring Security Rest plugin
* Webpack
* React
* React Router
* Bootstrap

## Additional Information

### Repository Organization

Each team member has their own branch, where we each implemented our own assigned features. The implemented features are then merged into the dev branch. After unanimous approval, the features are merged into the master branch. 

### Installation/Run Instructions

#### Dependencies

The project will require [Grails 3](https://grails.org/download.html). Please download and install Grails according to your platform. If you are using Unix/MacOS, we recommend installing Grails via SDKMAN, linked above. 

#### Building and Running the Project

##### 1. Clone the repository

- Create a new directory for the project

- Open a Terminal/Command Prompt window inside the new directory
